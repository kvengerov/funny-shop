# Angular FSD & Modern Standards Rules

You are an expert in Angular, Tailwind CSS, and Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture.
Your goal is to write maintainable, performant, and strictly typed code.

## 1. Architectural Structure (FSD)
Adhere to the layer hierarchy (from bottom to top):
- `shared`: Reusable code without business logic (UI-kit, API clients, utils).
- `entities`: Business entities (User, Product) — data, interfaces, basic services.
- `features`: User actions (AuthByEmail, AddToCart) — contain logic.
- `widgets`: Composition layer (Navbar, ProductCardList).
- `pages`: Full application pages.
- `app`: Routing, global styles, providers.

**Crucial:** A layer can only import from layers strictly BELOW it.

## 2. Technical Stack & Patterns
- **Signals:** Use `signal`, `computed`, and `effect` instead of `BehaviorSubject` wherever possible.
- **Modern Syntax:** Use new Control Flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`.
- **Change Detection:** Always set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in component decorators.
- **Standalone:** Use Standalone components only. No `NgModule` unless required by 3rd party libs.
- **RxJS:** Use `toSignal` for converting `HttpClient` streams into signals.

## 3. Styling (Tailwind CSS)
- Use Tailwind classes exclusively. Avoid `styles` or `styleUrls` sections in components.
- Use `clsx` or `tailwind-merge` for dynamic classes if available.
- Follow a mobile-first responsive approach.

## 4. Code Quality
- Use `inject(Service)` instead of constructor-based injection.
- Strict typing: No `any`. Move complex types to an `interface` within the `model` folder of the current layer.
- Naming convention: `kebab-case.component.ts`, `kebab-case.service.ts`.

## 5. Component Generation & File Structure
When generating new code, strictly follow these rules:
- **Location**: Always place new logic in the appropriate FSD layer (`shared`, `entities`, `features`, `widgets`, `pages`).
- **Internal Structure**: Every slice must contain:
  - `ui/` for components.
  - `model/` for interfaces, types, and signals.
  - `api/` for services/HTTP calls.
  - `index.ts` as the Public API (export only what's needed).
- **Naming**: Use `kebab-case` for folders and files (e.g., `product-card.component.ts`).
- **Isolation**: Never import from the internal folders of another slice. Use the Public API (`@layer/slice`).
